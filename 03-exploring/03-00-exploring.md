# Exploring the Data

In this section, we will present two ways to explore the DeepBlue metadata, organized in [Controlled Vocabularies](../02-data-types/02-03-controlled-vocabulary.md), and Data, which are organized into [Experiments](../02-data-types/02-01-experiments.md) and [Annotations](../02-data-types/02-02-annotations.md).

Each controlled vocabulary, experiment, and annotation has a [listing](03-01-listing.md) operation.
Although the [listing](03-01-listing.md) commands provide an easy interface for listing experiments, annotations, and Controlled Vocabularies content, it is not possible to filter the lists' content or perform search operations within them.
The DeepBlue command [search](http://deepblue.mpi-inf.mpg.de/api.html#api-search), for [free-text searching](03-02-free-text-searching.md), is used to cover the lack of dedicated list search operations.
The following sections will focus on the [listing](03-01-listing.md), [search](03-02-free-text-searching.md), and [data identifier](03-03-data-identifier.md) commands.
